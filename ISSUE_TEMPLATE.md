Welcome to MobX. Please provide as much relevant information as possible!

I have a*:

1. [ ] Question. Feel free to just state your question :) For a quick answer, there are usually people online at our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/mobxjs/mobx) channel
2. [ ] Issue. Please make sure you have the following:
  * [ ] **Provide error messages including stacktrace**
  * [ ] Provide as much **relevant code**, or, preferrably **create a reproduction based on this [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/mweststrate/wv3yopo0/)**: 
  * [ ] Did you check this issue wasn't filed before?
  * [ ] Elaborate on your issue. What behavior did you expect?
  * [ ] State the versions of MobX and relevant libraries. Which browser / node / ... version?
3. [ ] Idea
  * [ ] What problem would it solve for you?
  * [ ] Do you think others will benefit from this change as well?
  * [ ] Are you willing to (attempt) a PR yourself? (a javascript fork based on `npm run quick-build` is OK as well)
  * [ ] Are you willing to provide unit tests?
  * [ ] Are you willing to update the docs?
 Â * [x] Note it is not mandatory to provide good typescript typings if you are unfamiliar with typescript, writing JS with some `any`s is acceptable!
  
Please tick the appropriate boxes. Feel free to remove the other sections.
