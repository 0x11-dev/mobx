                            <a href="https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx"><code>MobX</code></a> is a simple, scalable and battle tested state management solution.
							This introduction will teach you all the imporant concepts of MobX
                            in ten minutes.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Core idea</h3>
						<p>
							State is at the heart of each application and there is no quicker way to create buggy, unmanagable applications then by 
							producing inconsistent states.
							Hence many state management solutions try to restrict the ways in which you can modify state, for example by making state immutable.
							But this introduces new problems; data need to be normalizeds, referential integrity can no longer be guaranteed and it becomes next to impossible to use convenient concepts like prototypes.
						</p><p>	 
							MobX makes state management simple again by addressing the root issue: it makes it impossible to produce inconsistent states.
							The strategy to achieve this is simple:
							<em>Make sure that everything that can be derived from the application state, will be derived. Automatically.</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							Conceptually MobX treats your application like a spreadsheet. 
						<p>
						<ol>
							<li>
							First of all, there is the <em>application state</em>.
							Graphs of objects, arrays, primitives, references that forms the model of your application.
							These values are the &ldquo;data cells&rdquo; of your application.
							Enterprise grade applications have complex, highly connected data models and MobX supports this.
							</li>
                            <li>MobX helps you managing all the <em>data</em> that describes the <em>state</em> of your application.
                                Data can have many forms, objects, arrays, references, class instances. Unlike many other
                                state management libraries, MobX <em>doesn't</em> care. If you were creating a spreadsheet;
                                the values of your data cells together are your application state. If you are building a
                                todo application, your state is the list of todos.
                            </li>
                            <li>Secondly there are <em>derivations</em>. Basically, and this is the core idea of MobX:
                                <em><b>Any value that can be computed automatically from the state of your application,
            should be (re-)computed automatically.</b></em> MobX will take care of this,
                                as long as you provide a derivation. These derivations, or computed values, can range from
                                be simple values like the number of unfinished todos, to complex stuff like a visual HTML
                                representation of your todos. In spreadsheet terms: these are the formulas and charts of
                                your application.
                            </li>
                            <li><em>Reactions</em> are very similar to derivations. The main difference: they don't produce a
                                value, but they execute some task for you whenever relevant state is changed. They make sure
                                that network requests are made automatically at the right time, or that debug information
                                is printed upon each change.
                            </li>
                            <li>Finally there are <em>actions</em>. Basically; all other code. Actions live outside MobX but
                                might alter your <em>state</em>. MobX will make sure that any changes to the application
                                state caused by your actions are automatically processed by all derivations and reactions.
                                Syncronously and glitch-free.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>A simple store...</h3>
                        <p>
                            Enough theory, seeing it in action probably explains more that carefully reading the above stuff. For originality's sake
                            let's start with a very simple ToDo store.
                            Note that all the code blocks below are editable,
                            So use the <em>run code</em> buttons to execute them. 
                            Below is a very straight forward <code>TodoStore</code> that maintains a collection of todos.
                            No MobX involved yet. 
                        </p>

                        <textarea spellcheck="false" class="prettyprint" id="code1" rows="25">
class TodoStore {
	todos = [];

	get completedTodosCount() {
    	return this.todos.filter(
			todo => todo.completed === true
		).length;
    }

	report() {
		if (this.todos.length === 0)
			return "<none>";
		return `Next todo: ${this.todos[0].task}. ` + 
			`Progress: ${this.completedTodosCount}/${this.todos.length}`; 
	}

    addTodo(task) {
		this.todos.push({ 
			task: task,
			completed: false,
            assignee: null
		});
	}
}

const todoStore = new TodoStore();
                        </textarea>
                        <button onClick="runCode(['#code1', '#code2'])" class="btn-run">Run code</button>

                        <p>We just created a <code>todoStore</code> instance with a <code>todos</code> collection. 
                            Time to fill the todoStore with some objects. 
                            To make sure we see the effects of our changes we invoke <code>todoStore.report</code> after each change and log it:
                        </p>

                        <textarea spellcheck="false" class="prettyprint" id="code2" rows="15">
todoStore.addTodo("read MobX tutorial");
console.log(todoStore.report());

todoStore.addTodo("try MobX");
console.log(todoStore.report());

todoStore.todos[0].completed = true;
console.log(todoStore.report());

todoStore.todos[1].task = "try MobX in own project";
console.log(todoStore.report());

todoStore.todos[0].task = "grok MobX tutorial";
console.log(todoStore.report());
                        </textarea>
                        <button onClick="runCode(['#code1', '#code2'])" class="btn-run">Run code</button>

                        <p>So far, there is nothing special about this code.
                            But what if we didn't have to call <code>report</code> explicitly, but could just declare that we want it to be invoked upon each state change?
                            That would free us from the responsibility of calling <code>report</code> from <em>any place</em> in our code
                            base that <em>might</em> affect the report.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And that is exactly what MobX can do for you. Automatically execute code that solely depends on state.
                            So that our <code>report</code> function updates automatically, just like a chart in a spreadsheet.
                            To achieve that, the <code>TodoStore</code> has to become observable so that MobX can track all the changes that are being made.
                            Let's alter the class just enough to achieve that.
                        </p>
                        <p>Also, the <code>completedTodosCount</code> property could be derived automatically from the todo
                            list. By using the <code>@observable</code> and <code>@computed</code> decorators we can introduce observable properties on an
                            object:
                        </p>

                        <p>We changed only a few things.
                            First, we marked some properties as being <code>observable<code>, this signals MobX that these values can change over time 
                            and that other data can be derived from them.
                            We also marked some properties as being <code>computed</code>. 
                            
                            , <code>todos</code> and
                            <code>completedTodosCount</code>.
                             Because we used a argumentless function as initial value for
                            <code>completedTodosCount</code>, <code>extendObservable</code> infers that the property should
                            become a computed value (computed values are just a special kind of observable values). The rest
                            of the listing hardly changes for you as a programmer, but <code>extendObservable</code> ensures
                            that MobX can track all changes made to the given properties.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <code>pendingRequests</code> and <code>assignee</code> attributes are not used so far,
                            but will be used later in this tutorial.
                            For brevity all examples on this page are using ES6, JSX and decorators. 
                            But don't worry, all decorators in MobX have an <a href="mobxjs.github.io/mobx/best/syntax.html" target="_blank">ES5</a> counterpart.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Secondly, we introduced a function in the constructor that prints the <code>report</code> and
                            is wrapped in <code>autorun</code>. Autorun creates a <em>reaction</em> that runs once, and after
                            that automatically re-runs whenever any observable data that was used inside the function changes.
                            Because <code>report</code> uses the observable <code>todos</code> property, it will print the
                            report whenever appropiate. This is demonstrated in the next listing. Just press the <em>run</em>                            button to try this.
                        </p>

                        <textarea spellcheck="false" class="prettyprint" id="code4" rows="6">
observableTodoStore.addTodo("read MobX tutorial");
observableTodoStore.addTodo("try MobX");
observableTodoStore.todos[0].completed = true;
observableTodoStore.todos[1].task = "try MobX in own project";
observableTodoStore.todos[0].task = "grok MobX tutorial";
                        </textarea>
                        <button onClick="runCode(['#code1', '#code3', '#code4'])" class="btn-run">Run code</button>

                        <p>Pure fun, right? The <code>report</code> did print automatically, synchronously and without leaking
                            intermediate values. If you investigate the log carefully, you will see that the fourth line
                            didn't result in a new log-line. Because the report did not <em>actually</em> change as a result
                            of the rename, although the backing data did. On the other hand, changing the name of the first
                            task did update the report, since that one is used in the report. This demonstrates nicely that
                            not just the <code>todos</code> property is being observed by the <code>autorun</code>, but also
                            the individual properties inside the todo items.
                        </p>
                        <h3 id="reactive-reactjs-components">Making react components reactive</h3>
                        <p>Ok, so far we made a silly report reactive. Let's build a reactive user interface around this very
                            same store. React components are (despite their name) not reactive out of the box, you need to
                            explicitly call <code>setState</code> or re-instantiate them in the parent's <code>render</code>                            method to force them to re-render after data has been changed.
                        </p>
                        <p>To avoid boilerplate and to make sure components update <em>smartly</em>, the <code>mobx-react</code>                            package provides the <code>observer</code> decorator / function that turns a component into a
                            <em>reaction</em>. From there on, you never have to worry about when to update your components!
                            It's conceptually no different from auto-running the <code>report</code> function.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The listing below defines some plain old react components. The only MobX thing in there is that they are passed through the
                            <em>observer</em> to make them reactive. After that, each component will individually re-render
                            when data changes. You don't have to call
                            <code>setState</code> anymore, nor do you have to figure out how subscribe to the proper parts
                            of your application state using selectors or higher order components that need to be configured.
                            Basically, all components have become smart but are still defined in a dumb, declarative manner.
                        </p>

                            feel free to play with it. Try for example to remove all the <code>observer</code> calls, or
                            just the one decorating the <code>TodoView</code>. The numbers in the preview on the right highlight
                            each time a component is rendered.

                        <h3>Working with references</h3>
                        <p>
                            So far we have created observable objects (both prototyped and plain objects), arrays and primitives. You might be wondering,
                            how are references handled in MobX? Is my state allowed to form a graph? In the previous listings
                            you might have noticed that there is an <code>assignee</code> property
                            on the todos. Let's give them some values by introducing a &ldquo;store&rdquo; (ok, it's just
                            a glorified array) containing people, and assign tasks to them.
                        </p>
                        <textarea spellcheck="false" class="" id="store2" rows="8">
var peopleStore = mobx.observable([
	{ name: "Michel" }, 
	{ name: "Me" } 
]);
observableTodoStore.todos[0].assignee = peopleStore[0];
observableTodoStore.todos[1].assignee = peopleStore[1];
peopleStore[0].name = "Michel Weststrate";
                        </textarea>
                        <button onClick="runCode(['#code1', '#code3', '#code4', '#react1', '#store2'])" class="btn-run">Run code</button>
                        <p>We now have two indepent stores. One with people and one with todos. To assign an <code>assignee</code>                            to a person from the people store, we just assigned a reference. These changes will be picked
                            up automatically by the <code>TodoView</code>. With MobX there is no need to normalize data first
                            and to write selectors to make sure our components will be updated. If fact, it doesn't even
                            matter where the data is stored. As long as objects are made <em>observable</em>, MobX will be
                            able to track them. Real javascript references will just work. MobX will track them automatically
                            if they are relevant for a derivation. To test that, just try changing your name in the next
                            input box (make sure you have pressed the above <em>Run code</em> button first!).
                        </p>
                        <hr/>
                        <p>Your name:
                            <input onkeyup="peopleStore[1].name = event.target.value" />
                        </p>
                        <hr/>
                        <p>By the way, the HTML of the above input box is simply: <pre>&lt;input onkeyup="peopleStore[1].name = event.target.value" /&gt;</pre></p>

                        <h3>Asynchronous actions</h3>
                        <p>Since everything in our small Todo application is derived from the state, it really doesn't matter <em>when</em> state is changed.
                            That makes creating asynchronous actions really straight forward.
                            Just press the the following button (multiple times) to asynchronously emulate loading new todo items:
                        </p>
                        <hr/>
                            <button onclick="observableTodoStore.pendingRequests++; setTimeout(function() { observableTodoStore.addTodo('Random Todo ' + Math.random()); observableTodoStore.pendingRequests--;  }, 2000);">Load todo</button>
                        <hr/>
                        <p>The code behind that is really straight forward. 
                            We start with uppdating the store property <code>pendingRequests</code> to have the UI reflect the current loading status.
                            Once loading is finished, we update the todo's of the store and decrease the <code>pendingRequests</code> counter again.
                            A counter is used to make sure we handle with multiple parallel requests properly:
<pre>observableTodoStore.pendingRequests++;
setTimeout(function() {
    observableTodoStore.addTodo('Random Todo ' + Math.random());
    observableTodoStore.pendingRequests--;
}, 2000);</pre>
                        </p>

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>
                            That's all! No boilerplate. Just some simple, declarative components that form our complete UI. And which are derived completely,
                            reactively from our state. You are now ready to start using the <code>mobx</code>                            and <code>mobx-react</code> packages in your own applications. A short summary of the things
                            you learned so far:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Use <code>observable(object or array)</code> or <code>extendObservable(object, propertiesMap)</code>                                to make objects suitable for using them in derivations.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Passing argumentless functions to <code>extendObservable</code> allows you to create &ldquo;formulas&rdquo;.
                                Functions that compute a value from the current state and which will be recomputed automatically
                                (if observed).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Use <code>autorun</code> to automatically run functions that depend on some observable state.
                                This is useful for logging, making network requests etc.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Use the <code>observer(react component)</code> function from the <code>mobx-react</code>                                package to make your React components truly reactive. They will update automatically and
                                efficiently. Even when used in large complex applications with large amounts of data.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Feel free to play around a bit longer with the editable code blocks above to get a basic feeling how MobX reacts to all your
                            changes. You could for example add a log statement to the <code>report</code>                            function to see when it is called. Or don't show the <code>report</code> at all and see how that
                            influences the rendering of the <code>TodoList</code>. Or show it only under specific circumstances...
