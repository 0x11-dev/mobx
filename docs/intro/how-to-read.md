# How to read this documentation

The documentation follows the principle that the most commonly used concepts are
introduced before specialized information. This applies to the headings in the table
of concepts as well as the pages under those headings.

We've marked sections and concepts that are more advanced and which you likely don't need to understand until you have a special use case with the [⚛️] marker. Feel free to skip them and move on to the next section!
