# Spy [ðŸš€]

Usage:

-   `spy(listener)`

Registers a global spy listener that listens to all events that happen in MobX.
It is similar to attaching an `observe` listener to _all_ observables at once, but also notifies about running (trans/re)actions and computations.
Used for example by the [MobX developer tools](../react/react-integration/md#mobxdevtools).

Example usage of spying all actions:

```javascript
spy(event => {
    if (event.type === "action") {
        console.log(`${event.name} with args: ${event.arguments}`)
    }
})
```

Spy listeners always receive one object, which usually has at least a `type` field. The following events are emitted by default by spy.

| type               | observableKind | other fields                                                              | nested |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| action             |                | name, object (scope), arguments[]                                         | yes    |
| scheduled-reaction |                | name                                                                      | no     |
| reaction           |                | name                                                                      | yes    |
| compute            |                | name                                                                      | no     |
| error              |                | name, message, error                                                      | no     |
| add                | object         | name, object, key, newValue                                               | yes    |
| update             | object         | name, object, key, newValue, oldValue                                     | yes    |
| remove             | object         | name, object, key, oldValue                                               | yes    |
| update             | array          | name, object (the array), index, newValue, oldValue                       | yes    |
| splice             | array          | name, object (the array), index, added, removed, addedCount, removedCount | yes    |
| add                | map            | name, object (observable map instance), key, newValue                     | yes    |
| update             | map            | name, object (observable map instance), key, newValue, oldValue           | yes    |
| delete             | map            | name, object (observable map instance), key, oldValue                     | yes    |
| add                | set            | name, object (observable set instance), newValue                          | yes    |
| delete             | set            | name, object (observable set instance), oldValue                          | yes    |
| create             | box            | name, object (Observable box instance), newValue                          | yes    |
| update             | box            | name, object (Observable box instance), newValue, oldValue                | yes    |
| report-end         |                | spyReportEnd=true, time? (total execution time in ms)                     | no     |

The `report-end` events are part of an earlier fired event that had `spyReportStart: true`.
This event indicates the end of an event and this way groups of events with sub-events are created.
This event might report the total execution time as well.

The spy events for observable values are identical to the events passed to `observe`. See [intercept & observe](observe.md) for an extensive overview.

In production builds, the `spy` API is a no-op as it will be minimized away.
